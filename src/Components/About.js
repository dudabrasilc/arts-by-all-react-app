      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I started drawing during my summer break from University back in 2015 in Brazil, where I was born and raised. Since then I love spending time drawing and playing around with my arts. I am also a Civil Engineer who's currently changing the field of study to Software Engineering. WoW! It might sound like a lot but drawing and coding are my passions, whenever I need a break from coding, I get a white paper and start creating something new. In this web page you can find some of my arts, feel free to explore!</p>
